  <p>Hello, my name is Brandon Smith and I am currently living in the capital of Florida, Tallahassee. I come from the beach town Ormond Beach which borders the world's most famous beach, Daytona Beach. I have recently enrolled into a coding course bootcamp offered from UCF. I plan to use this teaching from the bootcamp to further my education and help my future career as a programmer.</p>
